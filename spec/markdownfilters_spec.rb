## The Rainfall Problem ##

I read of a test given to students to see if they understand the concepts in the first part of a computer science course. It was in an interesting paper called *What Makes Code Hard to Understand?*[[http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5257|What Makes Code Hard to Understand? Michael Hansen, Robert L. Goldstone, Andrew Lumsdaine]].

> To solve it, students must write a program that averages a list of numbers (rainfall amounts), where the list is terminated with a specific value – e.g., a negative number or 999999.

Of course, reading about the problem I immediately wanted to try it, but even though the idea of posing the problem was to test the understanding of loops, the problem lends itself naturally to a recursive solution, and that's much more interesting than a boring old loop! I realised it wouldn't run well in Ruby but decided to write it anyway:

    ::::ruby
    def rainfall(droplets,total=0,measures=1,limit=99_999)
      return total.to_f.div measures if droplets == limit
      unless droplets < 0
        total += droplets
        measures += 1
      end
      rainfall rand(limit + 1), total, measures
    end

Normally I'd start this off with a random number, but just to make it clear that it works I started with the termination number. Then, I reran it until it worked. It gives you an idea of how poor Ruby is at recursion.

    ::::shell
    rainfall 99_999
    # => 0

This is one such case.]] solution.
